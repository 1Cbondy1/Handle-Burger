# Handle-Burger

Handle-Burger is a restaurant app that allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever the user submits a burger's name, it's displayed on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area has a 'Devour it!' button. When the button is clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 

Each burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not. Data is queried and routed using Node and MySQL. Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

Here is a link to the app deployed on Heroku:
